# Password-Strength-Evaluator
Utilizes Rust to analyze password strength by flagging common vulnerabilities and patterns.

## Project Goals 
⭐ Prompts user for password to validate 
⭐ Compares the entered password to flagged patterns and vulnerabilities
⭐ Outputs a password strength score and provides a summary with reasoning and tips if needed

## Core Components 
🐸 prompts user for password 
🐸 checks for basic features of a good password:
-length, use of upper and lower case 
-use of numerical characters 
-use of special characters 
-ensuring no patterns or common passwords 
🐸 compares passwords to hardcoded features to produce a strength score 
🐸 outputs a score and tips to improve password(if needed)
